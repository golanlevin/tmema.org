is revered in the annals of new media arts and theory, and for its role in the 
European, Oceanic and North American new media art scenes. Packed into 5 days 
at Linz, about an hour and a half from Vienna and straddling the River Danube, 
the event comprises a conference, an exhibition at the <I><FONT 
      color=black>Ars Electronica </FONT></I>Museum of the Future, the Prix at 
the OK Centruum, electronic theatre and live performance. Linz is small and it’s 
easy to flow between the riverside and downtown venues while media arts lay an 
incongruous internationalist map onto the medieval city. <P><FONT color=black>The 
conference is now rather institutionalised and themed (this year: Code = art, 
code = law, code = life). Among the exhibitions and performances there are 3 threads 
I want to mention: realtime video and audio manipulation; multi-user environments; 
and developments in tactile user interfaces. </FONT> <P><FONT color=black>Realtime 
manipulation of video and audio signal flow is a prevalent <I>techné</I>. The 
<I>Cinema Fabrique</I> (Justin Manor, USA) is a gesture-controlled, hardware/software 
environment for single-person improvisation. Holding a section of the interface 
in each hand, the visitor can choose, filter, scratch, loop and otherwise manipulate 
projected pop culture video/audio sequences. The 2-handed interface is enticing—it 
encourages expressive, free-form movement and a dance approach to interactivity. 
</FONT> <P><FONT color=black>The software artists TMEMA (Golan Levin, Zachary 
Leiberman USA) in collaboration with voice artists Jaap Blonk (NL) and Joan La 
Barbara (USA), performed the playful <I>Messa di Voce</I>. The piece is written 
in custom code developed during a residency at <I>Ars Electronica</I>, and is 
based on speech recognition algorithms. In what was more a series of set pieces 
than a fully realised performance, the vocalists were tracked spatially and their 
utterances analysed in real time. The system synthesises and outputs graphics 
in response—so Blonk performs his virtuosic vocals and the graphically rendered 
bubbles projected around his head are pushed up and suspended by the force of 
his breath. While the possibilities of the technical arrangements are very inspiring, 
I had to ask what creative and aesthetic development has been sacrificed for the 
complexity of the software development. </FONT> <P><FONT color=black>A wonderfully 
realised live performance with interactivity was <I>POL, a Mechatronic Performance</I> 
by Marcel-li Antunez Rocha (Spain). Two performers with exo-skeletal apparatus 
drive the fable of a rabbit’s search for love; performers’ action and voice, transcoded 
by the exo-skeleton, manipulate robotic offsiders, sound and projections. The 
complex, 3 channel Flash animations are synthesised into a retro-futuristic trope 
of mythical creatures, Bosch-like scapes and scenarios of sex, death and betrayal. 
The robotic and the cybernetic merge with an aesthetic of baroque intensity, evoking 
various origins of the abject and disembodied subject: surrealism, 1920s futurism, 
medievalism and collective fable. </FONT> <P><FONT color=black>Multiuser environments 
provide a challenge to new media artists and designers. <I>Instant City</I> (Sybille 
Hauert, Daniel Reichmuth, CH) is developed in Max/MSP. A very tactile interface 
helps—visitors stand around a square plinth on which they arrange acrylic blocks 
in architectural forms—the ‘buildings’ of the instant city. The placement and 
mass of the blocks manipulates the sound composition (visitors choose between 
6). The installation successfully brings visitors together across the top of the 
plinth: the acrylic blocks, lovely in their own sandblasted way, are non-threatening. 
It is easy to play with their manipulating effect and to tweak the compositions 
with a degree of finesse. </FONT> <P><FONT color=black><I>Access</I> by Marie 
Sester (France) allows more freeform audience response. A motion-tracking spotlight 
attaches itself to a passerby and follows them around the gallery. A simple idea, 
which has complex interactivity affect (people become self-conscious about ‘being 
in the spotlight’ and probably about the simplicity of the metaphor too). Why 
am I grinning so foolishly? Visitors become inventive—playing tag with the light, 
and with other potential ‘subjects’, pushing the installation to its limits. <I>Access</I> 
plays with notions of light as sprite, the audience as focus of attention, and 
an anthropomorphism we cannot help but bring to animated objects. </FONT> <P><FONT color=black>In 
<I>Pockets Full of Memories</I> (George Legrady, USA), visitors scan an object 
of their choice and enter associated metadata into a database. Throughout the 
duration of the exhibition the database grows and is continually reconfigured 
(and projected) as an emergent system using a Kohonen self-organising map algorithm. 
Although employing a single user interface, the installation evokes real world 
consciousness of being and contributing in a system with others, in which we nevertheless 
aim to make an individual mark. </FONT> <P><FONT color=black><I>Can you see me 
now?</I> (Blast Theory and The Mixed Reality Lab, University of Nottingham, UK) 
is an addition to an important body of multi-user performance works. <I>CUSMN</I> 
operates in the non-private, non-public cultural spaces emerging around wireless 
communications like mobile phones, GPS and 3G. ‘Real’ players on the street and 
online players inhabit the city and a virtual overlay—“the players online and 
the runners in the street enter into a relationship that is adversarial, playful 
and ultimately filled with pathos.” A crucial feature of Blast Theory projects 
is the ability to extend user and audience affect <I>outside</I> the game—rather 
than delimiting our consciousness to the stereotypical and virtual, the gameplay 
pushes us to understand aspects of ourselves, our communities and social responsibility. 
This is partially achieved by the very visceral gameplay—in <I>CUSMN</I> the players 
and gameplay self-generate affects of pursuer and pursued. In a new work, <I>Uncle 
Joe</I>, players are encouraged to bud
Joe</I>, players are encouraged to buddy up and commit to long term mutual support 
outside the game, without any mediation by the organisers. It was encouraging 
to see Blast Theory awarded the Prix Ars Electronica Golder Nica, which has in 
the past lauded some commercial, apolitical projects. </FONT> <P><FONT color=black>Developments 
in tactical user interface were particularly in evidence at the <I>Ars Electronic</I>a 
Centre. Many of these applications are prototypical and easily understood as collaborative 
production tools. However the possibility of artistic application imbues them 
with extra frisson. <I>The Audio Pad</I> (James Patten, Ben Recht, MIT, USA) enables 
sole or collaborative users to compose using freely mobile discs that trigger 
and manipulate predetermined audio compositional variables (eg timbre and pitch). 
The interface is very attractive, fluid and responsive. Also developed at MIT, 
the <I>SAND TRAY</I> tool enables multiple users to model interdependencies in 
earth science, engineering or hydraulic projects using a tray of coarse sand as 
the interface. Depending on how the sand is modelled—add a hill, flatten a mound—the 
effects on height, topography, water flow and temperature are calculated and projected 
back onto the sand in realtime. These innovations in tactical and multi-user interface 
address current issues about collaborative work process and the role of interactivity. 
</FONT> <P><FONT color=black>Other displays use sound as data input, and many 
visitors were fascinated by <I>Protrude, flow</I> by Sachiko Kodama and Minako 
Takeno (Japan), an installation of strongly magnetic fluid which responds to sound 
inputs. An attempt to model matter freely, as well as express wild and organic 
shapes, the work responds to synchronous sound by creating 3D patterns of splitting, 
clustering, flowing or dripping. </FONT> <P><FONT color=black>Finally, a whimsical 
work <I>Earth Core Laboratory and Elf Scan</I> (Agnes Meyer-Brandis, Germany) 
encourages a very careful, delicate form of tactical user interactivity. Based 
on the conceit that mineral-dwelling elves carry on a complex, humanoid life within 
a parallel universe of mineral cores, the work demands visitors very carefully 
scan the cores with some pseudo-scientific gear. The more careful, delicate and 
composed your search, the steadier your hand, the greater chance of seeing the 
little elf vignettes. </FONT> <P> <P> <P><FONT color=black>Ars Electronica, <I>directors
