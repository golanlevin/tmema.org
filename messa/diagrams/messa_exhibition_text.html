<b><br>4. Biographies</b> <p>Golan Levin is an artist, engineer, and composer 
interested in developing artifacts and events which explore supple new modes of 
interactive expression. His work focuses on the design of systems for the creation, 
manipulation and performance of simultaneous image and sound, as part of a more 
general inquiry into non-verbal communications protocols in cybernetic systems. 
Levin is Assistant Professor of Electronic Art at Carnegie Mellon University, 
Pittsburgh.</p><p>Zachary Lieberman is an artist, engineer, and educator whose 
work is focused on exploring the creative and human uses of technology. He produces 
installations, on-line works and concerts concerned with the themes of kinetic 
and gestural performance, interactive imaging and sound synthesis. Lieberman lives 
and works in New York City, where he teaches courses in audiovisual synthesis 
and creative image processing at Parsons School of Design.<br clear=all style='page-break-before:always'> 
</p><hr> <p><b>5. Project Description</b></p><p>Here is some text which describes 
the <i>Messa di Voce</i> installation.<br> (This text has about 1500 characters):</p><p><i>Messa 
di Voce<br> </i>Installation for Voice and Interactive Media<br> By Golan Levin 
and Zachary Lieberman<br> With Jaap Blonk and Joan La Barbara</p><p><i>Messa di 
Voce</i> is an audiovisual system in which the speech, shouts and songs produced 
by two vocalists are radically augmented in real-time by custom interactive visualization 
software. The installation touches on themes of abstract communication, synaesthetic 
relationships, cartoon language, and writing and scoring systems, within the context 
of a sophisticated and playful virtual world.</p><p>Levin and Lieberman's software 
transforms every vocal nuance into correspondingly complex, subtly differentiated 
and highly expressive graphics. These visuals not only depict the users' voices, 
but also serve as controls for their acoustic playback. While the voice-generated 
graphics thus become an instrument which the users can perform, body-based manipulations 
of these graphics additionally replay the sounds of the users' voices thus creating 
a cycle of interaction that fully integrates the visitors into an ambience consisting 
of sound, virtual objects and real-time processing.</p><p><i>Messa di Voce</i> 
lies at an intersection of human and technological performance extremes, melding 
the unpredictable spontaneity of the unconstrained human voice with the latest 
in computer vision and speech analysis technologies. Utterly wordless, yet profoundly 
verbal, <i>Messa di Voce</i> is designed to provoke questions about the meaning 
and effects of speech sounds, speech acts, and the immersive environment of language.</p><hr>
