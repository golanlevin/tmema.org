      <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In collaboration 
        with fellow software artist Zachary Lieberman and singers/composers Jaap 
        Blonk and Joan La Barbara, Golan Levin has created <i>Messa di Voce</i>, 
        a new concert in which the speech, shouts and song of two abstract vocalists 
        are complemented by corresponding live graphics. The show is part of Ultrasound 
        2003, Huddersfields international festival of experimental sound and electronic 
        music.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Please 
        explain <i>Messa di Voce</i> in layman's terms.</b> It means 'placing 
        the voice'. It's a performance in which we are visualizing the speech 
        and song of two singers with extended vocal techniques, in that they specialise 
        in making unusual vocal sounds. The concept is they're singing, and, as 
        they sing, it has been visualised behind them on a large screen.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Right. 
        And how do you do that exactly?</b> We've written all the software that 
        does the visualisation, which uses speech recognition technology. We know 
        where the performers' heads are, so we can make the graphics appear to 
        be emerging from them. We can change the colour or the shape or the texture 
        of the graphics to correspond with the singing.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>So were 
        you a software developer before embarking on this?</b> No, I'm an artist.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Did you 
        have to gen up on computer programming?</b> That's like asking a painter 
        if they had to learn how to use paint. I think every artist has to do 
        research into how to use their materials. The art here is software.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Sorry.</b> 
        That's OK. We've had some problems getting press about the project because 
        no one knows quite how to categorise it. Is it visual? Is it a music concert? 
        We're well into the 21st century and we're ready for a new form of performance. 
        Although, in a way, we've had it for 100 years and we've called it cinema 
        - but this is live.</font></p>
